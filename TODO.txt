Check Helium derivative in yonas code

Eigenstate file validation??



1) ecs seems to fail in 3d case (maybe all cases?)
- even when forced to run in 3d mode - everything works when aligned with the z-access.
- the only thing we really changed was the circular pulses?
- and vector arithmetic but this seems fine.

3) test photoionization


add "propagate: true/false" to input for TDSE
Recompute observables from initial/final wavefunction
